This is a sample application that demonstrates how you can use Dialoguewise CMS in your Gatsby application.

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have Gatsby installed on your local computer. If not, please refer to [Set Up Your Development Environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/) to get started.

## Getting started

To get started, clone or download this application and then run `npm install` to install all the npm packages.

Once this is done, update [gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/dialoguewise/gatsby-source-dialoguewise/blob/master/gatsby-test-app/gatsby-config.js) and [index.js](https://github.com/dialoguewise/gatsby-source-dialoguewise/blob/master/gatsby-test-app/src/pages/index.js) with your access token or the API key and the slug.

Now run the app using `gatsby develop` and you should be able to see your content.
